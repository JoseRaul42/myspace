  <p>Self Taught DeveloperðŸ’»ðŸ‘¾ðŸ’¾</p>
  <h5>Full Stack Developer with expertise in SQL, databases, and developing ETL pipelines. I have been programming and bringing my ideas to life through code since 2018. Adept at developing with SQL, C#, .NET, JavaScript, and Python, I have a proven track record of crafting scalable data solutions and backend software application support. My experience includes completing complex data-driven projects while applying engineering best practices to develop high-quality production implementations and data conversions. Currently, my major areas of interest in my free time are testing the use cases of building applications around locally hosted LLMs on consumer-grade hardware, following cybersecurity trends, and playing Elden Ring.</h5>

  <p style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Working on this project taught me a lot about efficiently parsing JSON from APIs, which was crucial for interpreting data from my local LLM instance. I developed APIs in OpenAI format to make it possible for my console application to communicate with my local LLM server. I also learned how to optimize LLM performance on my local hardware to speed up query processing. Additionally, setting up and fine-tuning my Snort Intrusion Detection System (IDS) rules helped me reduce false positives. I also used Docker to easily set up a Milvus standalone database to connect with my application. All of these steps were necessary to accomplish my goal of being able to generate real-time reports leveraging AI on Alert Logs files and ask questions about the alert logs in natural language.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.4rem;">This was a fun weekend project, inspired by my past experiences customizing my Myspace page during an earlier era of social media. I was able to learn a lot about reactive web design. This was developed using Svelte, my preferred front-end framework.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Data Recovery is a Python-based command-line tool designed to recover deleted files from various storage devices. Utilizing byte-level scanning, it identifies files based on their unique signatures, offering a chance to restore files that have been inadvertently deleted or lost.</p>
